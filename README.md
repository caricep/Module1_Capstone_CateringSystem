# Module 1 Capstone Project - Catering System
Completed after 4 weeks of learning Java. Designed and implemented a catering system application with a classmate. The application interacted with the user via a console interface and had the ability to keep track of inventory, allow the user to add money to their account balance, select products to purchase, make change, and produce transaction logs.
